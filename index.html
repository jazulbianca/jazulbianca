            <h2>Historical Perspective on Computing</h2>
            <p>Computing has undergone significant transformations since its inception. From the early mechanical computers to the modern era of artificial intelligence, the field has evolved rapidly.</p>
            <h3>Key Milestones:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1822: Charles Babbage proposes the idea of a mechanical computer, the Difference Engine.</li>
                <li>1943: The first electronic computer, Colossus, is developed to crack German codes during World War II.</li>
                <li>1951: The first commercial computer, UNIVAC I, is released.</li>
                <li>1969: The first network, ARPANET, is developed, marking the beginning of the internet.</li>
                <li>1981: The first personal computer, IBM PC, is released.</li>
                <li>1991: The World Wide Web is invented by Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
                <li>2010s: The rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Influential Figures:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Charles Babbage: Father of the computer.</li>
                <li>Alan Turing: Developed the concept of the universal Turing machine.</li>
                <li>Grace Hopper: Pioneering computer scientist and developer of the first compiler.</li>
                <li>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak: Co-founders of Apple and developers of the Apple I and Apple II personal computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Computing has had a profound impact on society, transforming the way we live, work, and communicate. It has enabled rapid global connectivity, facilitated e-commerce, and improved healthcare outcomes.</p>
